    Client DHT Remove request definitions / handler.

    The Remove request attempts to remove one record from the specified DHT
    channel. This works as follows:
        1. The client selects a connected DHT node from its registry, based on
           the key of the record to be read.
        2. A request is sent to the selected node, asking for the specified
           record in the specified channel to be removed.
        3. The request ends when either the record is removed from the node, is
           found to not exist, or the node could not handle the request due to
           an error.

    During a data redistribution, more than one node may be responsible for a
    given key. In this case, the node that was least recently reported as being
    responsible for the key is queried first, followed by others (in order)
    until the record is either removed from or does not exist on all nodes, or
    an error occurs. The reason for removing from the *least* recently
    responsible nodes first is to avoid getting into inconsistent states if an
    error occurs while removing. (If an error occurred when removing the record
    from the most recently responsible node first, subsequent read requests
    would fetch the removed record from older nodes, and the old value could be
    forwarded from an older node, undoing the removal.)
