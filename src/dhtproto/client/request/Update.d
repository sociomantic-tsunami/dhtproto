/*******************************************************************************

    Client DHT Update request definitions / handler.

    The Update request attempts to read one record from the specified DHT
    channel and replace its value in the DHT with a modified version, specified
    by the user. This works as follows:
        1. The client selects a connected DHT node from its registry, based on
           the key of the record to be updated.
        2. A request is sent to the selected node, asking for the specified
           record in the specified channel to be returned.
        3. If the record exists, its value is passed to the user, who may
           provide a modified version of the value or decide to leave the value
           as it is.
        4. The modified version of the value is then sent back to the DHT. One
           of the following then happens:
            4a. The record has been modified by another request, in the
                meantime. The Update request is rejected and has no effect. (The
                user may retry the request.)
            4b. The record has either been removed of has not been modified, in
                the meantime. The new value is written to the DHT.
        5. The request ends when either the record does not exist, is
           successfully updated in the node, or the node could not handle the
           request due to an error.

    During a data redistribution, more than one node may be responsible for a
    given key. In this case, the following logic is used:
        * Reading: the node that was most recently reported as being responsible
          for the key is queried first, followed by others (in order) until the
          record is located, an error occurs, or no node has the record.
        * Updating: the modified record is written to the node that was most
          recently reported as being responsible for the key. If this is
          different to the node that the record was read from, the source node
          is instructed to remove the record.
